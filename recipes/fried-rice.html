    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A staple in every Asian home. It is an extremely flexible dish
        where you can put whatever you want. Tread carefully with what you put
        because this is also a testament to how good your tastebuds are.

    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Frying pan</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Meat of choice</li>
        <li>Sauce of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice in the frying pan and add some chopped garlic and oil
            to add flavor and that aroma of fried rice.
        </li>
        <li>After a couple minutes, add the vegetables.</li>
        <li>As you cook the vegetables, add some sauce of your choice. I'd recommend soy sauce.</li>
        <li>Then chop up some meat like spam, and add it to your fried rice.</li>
        <li>Upon cooking it all, you can add whatever toppings. I would usually add kewpie mayo and yakisoba sauce.</li>
